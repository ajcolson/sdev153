            <h1>Ipsum</h1>
            <p>Anyone who has worked doing design work is likely very familiar with the phrase: <span class="fst-italic">Lorem Ipsum</span>. For those not in the know however, Lorem Ipsum refers to a set of text that is used as a placeholder. Theis placeholder text allows a designer to quickly add demo text that will be used to help visiualize and modify the flow and layout of a page or document.</p>
            <p>The words Lorem Ipsum themselves are Latin and have the loose translation of "pain itself". However, when designers are using Lorem Ipsum style text, the meaning of the words is not important. If someone were to attempt to translation a full block of Lorem Ipsum text, they would find it to be nonsensical.</p>
            <p>Here is an example of some Lorem Ipsum text:</p>
            <div class="fst-italic border border-secondary-subtle p-3 rounded-3 blockquote">
              <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Felis vivamus donec facilisis class primis sed volutpat volutpat taciti eleifend volutpat. Pharetra magna nisi justo enim conubia rhoncus placerat vivamus et. Pulvinar malesuada metus maximus erat mollis porta. Aenean ultricies consectetur curabitur libero hac fermentum maximus nostra libero morbi mi. Aenean congue cras est sem mattis orci non.</p>
              <p>Velit habitant aliquet suspendisse amet nisl eget ultrices. Velit morbi ante fusce dapibus massa feugiat tincidunt senectus. Inceptos dolor aptent felis class odio vitae sollicitudin. Mi hac auctor dolor pellentesque vitae.</p>
              <p>Sed a hac potenti netus mi blandit suscipit facilisis nostra urna interdum purus suspendisse praesent pretium. Morbi dolor turpis porttitor velit imperdiet libero libero. Pharetra duis gravida maecenas suscipit vestibulum justo gravida suspendisse scelerisque. Dui leo ornare nibh torquent molestie taciti duis vulputate metus lectus id at neque aliquam neque. Justo dapibus nisl nec integer fames purus fusce magna sollicitudin.</p>
              <p>Molestie at risus etiam velit primis gravida etiam purus luctus eleifend fringilla neque sapien eleifend congue. Fringilla aptent luctus amet proin conubia tellus leo urna senectus scelerisque vivamus mollis vel. Facilisis malesuada quam tristique conubia curabitur non.</p>
              <p>Ex a adipiscing etiam suspendisse ac aliquet conubia mattis id turpis vitae ante eget ultricies. Hendrerit tempor erat quam adipiscing erat nisl commodo fringilla suspendisse vel inceptos ligula tempus. Aliquam eleifend viverra dictumst elit dapibus nisi.um egestas. Iaculis massa nisl malesuada lacinia integer nunc posuere. Ut hendrerit semper vel class aptent taciti sociosqu. Ad litora torquent per conubia nostra inceptos himenaeos.</p>

            <p>While this is fully functional for the task of just getting some mockup text for your design work, it can feel bland and seem uninteresting to look at. Thankfully (and excitedly), the internet and fellow designers have come up with alternatives to the tradiontal Lorem Ipsum text. Let's look at just two...</p>
            <h2>Legal Ipsum</h2>
            <p>Legal Ipsum is a personal favorite of mine. Although it is just as nonsensical as tradional Lorem Ipsum text, it looks and feels more professional while doing so.</p>
            <p>There are a number of websites that will help you generate Legal Ipsum text, but I recommend using <a href="http://legalipsum.com" target="_blank">legalipusm.com</a> if you are looking to try it for yourself. Here is a sample output:</p>
            <div class="fst-italic border border-secondary-subtle p-3 rounded-3 blockquote">

            <h2>Pirate Ipsum</h2>
            <p>Whereas Lorem Ipsum and Legal Ipsum read as being serious looking and sounding professional, Pirate Ipsum is a funny variation of placeholder text. It best read out loud and being spoken in the most sterotypical pirate accent you can imagine.</p>
            <p>Again, there are many websites that will help you create Pirate Ipsum text. I personally like the aesthetics of <a href="https://pirateipsum.me/" target="_blank">pirateipsum.me</a>. Here is some sample text:</p>
            <div class="fst-italic border border-secondary-subtle p-3 rounded-3 blockquote">
              <p>A barnacle-covered pirate never swim without his black doubloon and rum. The cursed landlubber fight toward the cursed vessel with old intent. No cursed sea ever commandeer from the mighty matey of Captain scallywag. Yo-ho-ho! golden parrot be ready to escape the seaworthy grog. The stolen quartermaster swim toward the mighty deck with fearsome intent. No cursed anchor ever fight from the rusty parrot of Captain crew.</p>
              <p>Shiver me timbers! Me doubloon be splice for stolen vessel and doubloon. A salty pirate never bury without his barnacle-covered vessel and sea. When the parrot swing, the rusty crew must keelhaul or face the ocean. No stolen captain ever escape from the trusty sea of Captain doubloon. board the old chest before the silver bury our sail. Heave ho! board the scallywag and commandeer the fearsome crew! Shiver me timbers! Me plank be drink for barnacle-covered treasure and captain.</p>
              <p>swab the golden map before the chest sail our crew. A wooden pirate never drink without his scurvy ocean and vessel. maroon the rusty rum before the landlubber commandeer our treasure. Arr! rusty vessel be ready to navigate the barnacle-covered cannon. The old deck board toward the brave sea with mighty intent. Yo-ho-ho! Me anchor be splice for golden sail and gold. Ahoy! wooden rum be ready to board the barnacle-covered sea. Blimey! plunder the parrot and drink the brave silver!</p>
              <p>The barnacle-covered map maroon toward the trusty matey with black intent. Savvy? stolen captain be ready to splice the scurvy ocean. Walk the plank! mighty cutlass be ready to swim the weathered quartermaster. Yo-ho-ho! sail the treasure and maroon the old landlubber! Shiver me timbers! escape the sea and board the golden barnacle! Heave ho! commandeer the anchor and steal the wooden sea!</p>
              <p>Land ho! weathered barnacle be ready to swim the salty chest. navigate the fearsome sail before the scallywag bury our grog. No mighty doubloon ever splice from the trusty grog of Captain cutlass. Avast! cursed landlubber be ready to splice the cursed sea. No wooden treasure ever splice from the brave rum of Captain ship. Ahoy! Me grog be sail for black chest and barnacle. Heave ho! Me cutlass be board for seaworthy ship and treasure.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Although at the end of the day, placeholder text is meant to be just a temporary design element rarily seen by the public, I still think and recommend having fun with the process. There are more variations of Ipsum text that can be found online. Consider using one or more of these for you next project.</p>
