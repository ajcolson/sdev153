            <h1>Project Euler</h1>
            <p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> is a website first introduced to me 2010. At the time, I was beginning to learn to program and was looking for some ideas on projects or problems that I could work on.</p>
            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>What is this site you ask? Naturally I asked the same question! In the website's own words:
              <div class="fst-italic border border-secondary-subtle p-3 rounded-3 blockquote">Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.</div></p>
            <p>As someone who has had a lifelong love of studying mathematics, this website immediately drew my attention. I knew this was the perfect place to find project ideas. Over the years, anytime I have tried to pick and learn a new programming language, I will often grab one of the problems from the site and see if I program a solution for it. I might even take code I have from a previous attempt as a template.</p>
            <h2>An example problem.</h2>
            <p>The best way to understand and experience the site is to try one of the problems for yourself! There's no wrong place to start, though the difficulty of some of the problems might be a bit daunting at first.</p>
            <p>As a soft introduction, I'll recommend you try <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=13" target="_blank">Problem 13 - Large Sum</a>. The objective of the problem is to find the sum of a list of numbers. This problem is, at least to my mind, fairly easy to understand and provides a decent challenge without requiring you to dust off a calculus book and finish a PhD in Computer Science. That said, this problem shouldn't be taken lightly either.</p>
            <p>I encourage you to give it an honest attempt at solving the problem. You might even find the process fun! One hint I will offer to help you along is: <span class="fst-italic">There is more one way to look at a number.</span></p>
            <p>However, if you want to simply skip to the answer or see a possible solution to the problem, then I have <a href="https://github.com/ajcolson/euler13-csharp" target="_blank">one solution</a> for you can review hosted on GitHub. The solution is written in C#, so if you want to run the code yourself, you will need to have familiarity with compiling the language.</p>
